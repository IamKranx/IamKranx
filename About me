Hello, my name is KauÃª, but I'm known as Kranx. Foreigners who can't speak portuguese won't be able to understand almost anything in my bot, because I am brazilian and obviously made Kanshi in portuguese language. I also understand english but I decided to make Kanshi in portuguese because it will make it easier for people who don't understand english. 

Maybe in the future I will put translation commands in my bot, I am sure that will make it easier for the gringos.

I'm just finishing creating my first Javascript bot for Discord.

I already have some experience creating Discord servers and now I'm looking to get some experience creating Javascript bots. I had a first bot made by me in Python, but I decided to delete the whole project, because I was not satisfied with creating a Discord bot through the simplest programming language (which in this case is Python).

The name of my Discord bot is Kanshi, I named it with this name, because I decided to make it almost like my name. Maybe neither me nor Kanshi (My bot) will ever be forgotten.

I also created a server for myself that will also serve as a support server for Kanshi.

My idea about Kanshi is to make it an "all-purpose" bot, like;

It has fun commands, it has some moderation commands, utilities and much more.
